          ### Why Best Practices


          Learn from the pain of developers past. Search Stack Overflow like a
          boss!


          *"Back in my day, we solved our own problems"

          \- Some Dinosaur Developer*
      - content: >
          ### Why Code Comments


          Try writing complex code on a Friday and then explaining it to your
          co-worker next Thursday.


          Can't do it? This chapter is for you!

          ### Why Bugs are Good


          Video-games taught me when I see bad guys, I'm going in the right
          direction.

          Bugs are like a developer's bad-guy, right?


          Wrong.

          ### Why Documentation is Great


          Run a team? Get a VR headset and play [Keep Talking and No One
          Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com) (also on
          [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steelcrategames.keeptalkingandnobodyexplodes)
          /
          [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keep-talking-nobody-explodes/id1445772666)).

          Never under-appreciate good documentation ever again.

          ### Why Hack-a-thons


          True innovation comes from necessity. And since placing people into
          "Saw"-like situations are frowned-upon, learn to harness the power of
          human psychology by implementing hackathons in a way that motivates
          and lets people innovate.

          ### Why Trust but Verify


          Every day we learn about companies getting hacked and your data being
          stolen. Fun.


          Web developers play an essential part in the security of the web and
          having good security practices from the start will be critical to
          avoid painful mistakes. Passw0rd1! isn't as secure as you think it is.
